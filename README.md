# 🎨🔬 Color Space Exploration with MATLAB 

Explore the fascinating world of color spaces using MATLAB! This repository contains a MATLAB script that demonstrates the conversion of an image through various color spaces including RGB, HSV, YCbCr, and Lab. Dive into the components of each color space and see how images are represented differently.

## 🚀 Features 

- **RGB Color Space Analysis** 🟥🟩🟦: Dissect an image into its Red, Green, and Blue components to understand how colors are combined in the digital world.
- **HSV Transformation** 🌈: Convert the RGB image to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and explore how colors can be represented in terms of their chromaticity and luminance.
- **YCbCr Conversion** 📺: Delve into the YCbCr color space, used extensively in video compression, to analyze the luminance and chrominance components of the image.
- **Lab Color Space** 🧪: Experience the Lab color space, which is designed to approximate human vision, focusing on perceptual uniformity.

🏁 ## Getting Started 

<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have MATLAB installed.
3. Open the script in MATLAB and run it.
4. The script will load a test image (ensure `test.jpg` is in your working directory), perform transformations, and display the results.
